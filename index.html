				For the 50th anniversary of The Beatles’s Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band <br> 
				album, the city of Liverpool has commissioned 13 new works, including public art, <br> 
				concerts, theatre and dance performances — each inspired by a song from the album. <br>
				Among the pieces unveiled in the city on Thursday, 1 June are a 12-metre-high <br> 
				psychedelic mural by the US artist Judy Chicago, a series of public billboards <br> 
				by the British artist Jeremy Deller.

					Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
				</h5>
				<p>
					"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is the eighth studio album by <br> 
					English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom <br>  
					and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and <br> 
					critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart <br> 
					and 15 weeks at number one in the US.

				Chicago says that although she was never a particularly big Beatles fan — <br> 
				<em>“I’m not the groupie type. I was in my studio”</em> — they represented <br> 
				<em>“hope and change”</em> to her. She was assigned the song Fixing a Hole <br> 
				as the starting point for her commission and after researching the various <br> 
				theories of the song’s meaning, from drug use to a hole in Paul McCartney’s <br> 
				new roof, she alighted on the idea of <em>“fixing a hole in history — who gets <br> 
				to participate in it”</em>. As an artist who has fought over much of her career <br> 
				to highlight the role of women in art history, Chicago says she <em>“related to that”</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The mural, titled Four Lads from Liverpool (2017), was still being completed <br> 
				today on the side of an old grain silo at the edge of one of the city’s former docks. <br>  
				Standing outside the hotel she is staying at across the water and using a <br> 
				telephoto lens, Chicago gave instructions to Gary Jones, a former sign painter, <br>  
				via mobile telephone: <em>“The shading on the head of Ringo looks really good!”</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Chicago says that people have been surprised she didn’t have a team of workers <br> 
				make the mural but she counters that by collaborating with one person—and naming <br> 
				him in the press material — <em>“it emphasises, in an era of big studios of nameless<br> 
				assistants, the individual’s voice”</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Meanwhile, Jeremy Deller has produced a series of signs and billboards in <br> 
				prominent locations around Liverpool declaring: “Brian Epstein died for you”. <br> 
				<em>“Our debt to him is huge”</em>, Deller says of Epstein, who discovered <br> 
				The Beatles and became their manager, as well as a close friend. <em>“I grew up <br> 
				with the band, and I’m mildly obsessed with [Epstein]”</em>, Deller adds.
			</p>

			<p>
				The public works come on the back of the Deller’s recent “Strong and Stable My Arse” <br> 
	 			fly-posters that sprung up around London last month, mocking the British <br> 
	 			Prime Minister Theresa May’s campaign slogan. Deller says he plans to use <br> 
	 			the medium again in the future as it is <em>“very effective—its good [for people] <br> 
	 			to see something real”</em>, as opposed to online.
			</p>

			<p>
				The song assigned to Deller was "With a Little Help from My Friends", and <br> 
				a further performance piece inspired by it, will take place on Friday. <br> 
				The work is a closely guarded secret, with Deller only revealing that <br> 
				there will be <em>“things happening in the city”</em>.
